# Refactoring Roadmap

Items here are known issues with root causes identified but not yet fixed.
Per CLAUDE.md policy: every patch-only fix must land here before being shipped.
Fix in Claude Code where noted — these require proper branching and testing.

## Open: Needs Root Cause Fix

### 3. Stale ghost row in `reconciliation_log.csv` for JoJo Citi Costco May 2026
**File:** `Bookkeeping-clients/reconciliation_log.csv`
**Root cause:** The timed-out `reconcile_comprehensive.py` run early in the session
wrote a row for `citi_visa_costco / 05/20/26` with `total_payments = 0.00` and
no `account_ending`. The correct row (written later) has `total_payments = 5316.23`
and `account_ending = 3003`. The ghost row is harmless now (string sort picks
the June date) but will cause confusion on future audits.
**Fix:** Delete the ghost row in `Bookkeeping-clients` — keep only the row with
`account_ending = 3003` and correct `total_payments`.

## Closed: Fixed

- `citi_visa_costco → citi_costco` alias missing from `load_reconciliation_log`
  in `send_morning_digest.py` — fixed 2026-06-22 by reading `acct_type_map`
  from `sheets_config.json` instead of a hardcoded dict.
- `repository_dispatch` in `reconcile_comprehensive.py` pointed at old repo
  `sarah-levine/Bookkeeping` — fixed 2026-06-22 to use `Bookkeeping-clients/dispatches`
  with `event_type: logs-updated`.
- `manual_statement_entry.py` had no sheet sync dispatch — fixed 2026-06-22.
- `CitiVisaCostcoParser.generate_report()` not passing `statement_date` to
  `_report_header` in the `load_from_dict` path — fixed 2026-06-22.
- `citi_visa_costco` not supported in `manual_statement_entry.py` — fixed
  2026-06-22 by adding `load_from_dict` to `CitiVisaCostcoParser` and wiring
  the type into `PARSER_BY_TYPE`.
- `write_both_logs` upsert key only matched `(client, account_type)` — fixed
  2026-06-24 by adding `statement_date` to the key, matching `upsert_recon_log`.
- `manual_statement_entry.py` never wrote to logs — fixed 2026-06-24 by calling
  `write_both_logs` after `generate_report()`; also added `bmo_credit` to
  `PARSER_BY_TYPE`.
- No BMO credit card parser — fixed 2026-06-24 by adding `BMOCreditCardParser`
  to `parsers/bmo.py` with `load_from_dict()`, `parse()`, `generate_report()`,
  and `_expand_date()` (MM/DD/YYYY normalization); wired `bmo_credit` into
  `detect_statement_type()`, `STATEMENT_TYPE_LABELS`, and the parser dispatch in
  `reconcile_comprehensive.py`. Pure-Python PDF text extraction and OCR fallback
  (pdftoppm + tesseract) added in `parsers/pdf_utils.py`.
- `detect_statement_type()` OCR fallback missing `bmo_credit` branch — fixed
  2026-06-24 by adding a `bmo_credit` check before `bmo_checking` in the OCR
  fallback block, keying on `BUSINESS PLATINUM`/`PLATINUM REWARDS`/`REWARDS
  CREDIT CARD`/`INDIVIDUAL BILL ACCOUNT` with guards against checking keywords.
- `BMOCreditCardParser._extract_text()` timed out on scanned PDFs — fixed
  2026-06-24 by replacing the bare pdftotext-only fallback with the same
  PyMuPDF + pytesseract pattern used by `BMOCheckingParser`.
