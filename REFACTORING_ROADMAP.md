# Refactoring Roadmap

Items here are known issues with root causes identified but not yet fixed.
Per CLAUDE.md policy: every patch-only fix must land here before being shipped.
Fix in Claude Code where noted — these require proper branching and testing.

## Open: Needs Root Cause Fix

### Schema `statement_types` enum drifts from actual parsers
The `clients/_schema.json` enum for `statement_types` is a manually maintained
list. Any new parser or cardholder-specific subtype (e.g. `bmo_credit_roger`)
requires a manual schema update or jsonschema validation silently skips the
entire client config, blocking all clients on startup.

**Patched:** added `bmo_savings`, `bmo_credit_roger/nicholas/peter/christopher`
to the enum on 2026-06-24.

**Root cause to investigate:** Consider removing the `enum` constraint from
`statement_types` items entirely and letting runtime parser matching handle
unknown types — the schema doesn't need to gatekeep what the parsers already
validate. Alternatively, auto-derive the enum from registered parser
`statement_type` keys at schema generation time.

## Closed: Fixed

- Pay-by-Pay (workers comp) silently dropped from payroll JE — fixed 2026-06-24:
  `adp_payroll_departments` now extracts `DebitforPay-by-Pay` from Liability PDF in
  `parse_cash_splits()`; all three formats (`departments`, `professional`, `1099`) emit
  debit+credit rows using `workers_comp_account`/`pay_by_pay_account` config key and
  print a JE balance cross-check. Code supports both key names; rename `pay_by_pay_account`
  → `workers_comp_account` in client configs when convenient.
- Ghost row in `reconciliation_log.csv` for a Citi Costco May 2026 entry (`total_payments = 0.00`,
  no `account_ending`) — confirmed absent from Bookkeeping-clients on 2026-06-24; row was
  never written to the canonical copy, so no deletion needed.
- `citi_visa_costco → citi_costco` alias missing from `load_reconciliation_log`
  in `send_morning_digest.py` — fixed 2026-06-22 by reading `acct_type_map`
  from `sheets_config.json` instead of a hardcoded dict.
- `repository_dispatch` in `reconcile_comprehensive.py` pointed at old repo
  `sarah-levine/Bookkeeping` — fixed 2026-06-22 to use `Bookkeeping-clients/dispatches`
  with `event_type: logs-updated`.
- `manual_statement_entry.py` had no sheet sync dispatch — fixed 2026-06-22.
- `CitiVisaCostcoParser.generate_report()` not passing `statement_date` to
  `_report_header` in the `load_from_dict` path — fixed 2026-06-22.
- `citi_visa_costco` not supported in `manual_statement_entry.py` — fixed
  2026-06-22 by adding `load_from_dict` to `CitiVisaCostcoParser` and wiring
  the type into `PARSER_BY_TYPE`.
- `write_both_logs` upsert key only matched `(client, account_type)` — fixed
  2026-06-24 by adding `statement_date` to the key, matching `upsert_recon_log`.
- `manual_statement_entry.py` never wrote to logs — fixed 2026-06-24 by calling
  `write_both_logs` after `generate_report()`; also added `bmo_credit` to
  `PARSER_BY_TYPE`.
- No BMO credit card parser — fixed 2026-06-24 by adding `BMOCreditCardParser`
  to `parsers/bmo.py` with `load_from_dict()`, `parse()`, `generate_report()`,
  and `_expand_date()` (MM/DD/YYYY normalization); wired `bmo_credit` into
  `detect_statement_type()`, `STATEMENT_TYPE_LABELS`, and the parser dispatch in
  `reconcile_comprehensive.py`. Pure-Python PDF text extraction and OCR fallback
  (pdftoppm + tesseract) added in `parsers/pdf_utils.py`.
- `detect_statement_type()` OCR fallback missing `bmo_credit` branch — fixed
  2026-06-24 by adding a `bmo_credit` check before `bmo_checking` in the OCR
  fallback block, keying on `BUSINESS PLATINUM`/`PLATINUM REWARDS`/`REWARDS
  CREDIT CARD`/`INDIVIDUAL BILL ACCOUNT` with guards against checking keywords.
- `BMOCreditCardParser._extract_text()` timed out on scanned PDFs — fixed
  2026-06-24 by replacing the bare pdftotext-only fallback with the same
  PyMuPDF + pytesseract pattern used by `BMOCheckingParser`.
